This repository contains the code modifications we had to make to run RAINCOAT on the WISDM data. It includes all the necessary modules for execution and the associated data.

To reproduce the figures from our article, open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab. Make sure that Raincoat is in the wdir path. Then execute the cells.
